# Password Guesser

----

You must have Python 3 installed (Python 3.12 preferred) to run. If python is properly installed, you can run `PasswordGuesser.py` to run the program.

Input a username when prompted (any username), then enter a password (any password). This should not be real login info, and it works no matter what you input. 
The program will then output a series of operations that it should be doing, and then will tell you your password that you entered.

No data is saved, so if you do happen to input real login info, it makes no difference.

This program is a complete joke, but it also works with 100% accuracy.
